### Problem Statement
Given an integer array A, find the maximum subarray sum out of all the subarrays.

### Examples
**Example 1**:
For the given array A with length N,  

| Index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

**Output:** 
```plaintext
Max Sum: 11
Subarray: 3 4 -1 5
```


**Example 2:**
For the given array A with it's length as N we have,  

| Index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Array | -3  |  4  |  6  |  8  | -10 |  2  |  7  |

**Output:**
```plaintext
Max Sum: 18
Subarray: 4 6 8
```

### Find Maximum Subarray Sum Brute Force

#### Brute Force
No of possible subarrays: `N * (N + 1) / 2`

Iterate over all subarrays, calculate sum and maintain the maximum sum.

#### Psuedocode:
```java
ans = A[0];
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) { // start to N
    for (j = i; j < N; j++) { // end
        for (k = i; k <= j; k++) {
            sum += A[k];
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans, sum);
        sum = 0; // Reset sum for the next iteration
    }
}
return ans;

```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** `O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)`
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

:warning:Please take some time to think about the optimised approach on your own before reading further.....

### Find Maximum Subarray Sum using Carry Forward
#### Optimized Solution using Carry Forward
We don't really need the third loop present in brute force, we can optimise it further using Carry Forward technique.

#### Psuedocode
```java
ans = A[0]
for (i = 0 to N - 1) { //start to N
    sum = 0
    for (j = i to N - 1) { //end
        sum += A[k]
        ans = max(ans, sum)
    }
}
return ans;
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(N^2)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Find Maximum Subarray Sum using Kadanes Algorithm

#### Observation:

**Case 1:**
If all the elements in the array are positive
Arr[] = `[4, 2, 1, 6, 7]`

**Answer:**
To find the maximum subarray we will now add all the positive elements
Ans: `(4 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 7) = 20`


**Case 2:**

If all the elements in the array are negative 
Arr[] = `[-4, -8, -9, -3, -5]`

**Answer:**
Here, since a subarray should contain at least one element, the max subarray would be the element with the max value
Ans: `-3`


**Case 3:**

If positives are present in between
Arr[] = [-ve -ve -ve `+ve +ve +ve +ve` -ve -ve -ve]

**Answer:**
Here max sum would be the sum of all positive numbers 


**Case 4:** 
If all negatives are present either on left side or right side.
Arr[ ] = [-ve -ve -ve `+ve +ve +ve +ve`]
OR
Arr[ ] = [`+ve +ve +ve +ve` -ve -ve -ve -ve]

**Answer:**
All postives on sides



Case 5 :
**Hint:**
What if it's some ve+ followed by some ve- and then again some more positives...

```plaintext
+ve +ve +ve -ve -ve -ve +ve +ve +ve +ve +ve
```

#### Solution:
We will take all positives, then we consider negatives only if the overall sum is positive because in the future if positives come, they may further increase this positivity(sum).


**Example** -
```plaintext
A[ ] = { -2, 3, 4, -1, 5, -10, 7 }
```
Answer array: 3, 4, -1, 5


**Explanation**:
3+4 = 7
7 + (-1) = 6 (still positive)
6+5 = 11 (higher than 7)

#### Dry Run

|  5  |    6 + 5    |   11   |                                                                             |
|  6  | 6 + 5 - 3 = 8 |   11   | Keep currSum as 8 only since if we find a positive, it can increase the sum |

|  i  | currSum | maxSum |                                                                             |
|:---:|:-------:|:------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  7  | 8 + 8 = 16  |   16   |                                                                             |
|  8  | 16 - 2 = 14 |   16   | Keep currSum as 8 only since if we find a positive, it can increase the sum |

Final maxSum = 16

### Problem 2 Perform multiple Queries from i to last index


#### Problem Statement

Given an integer array A where every element is 0, return the final array after performing multiple queries

**Query (i, x):** Add x to all the numbers from index i to N-1

**Example**
Let's say we have a zero-filled array of size 7 with the following queries: 

Query(1, 3)
Query(4, -2)
Query(3, 1)

Let's perform these queries and see how it works out. 

**Example Explanation**
| Index | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6     |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| **Array**      |    0 | 0    |  0   |  0   | 0    | 0    | 0      |
|     **Q1**  |   :  |   +3  | +3    | +3    | +3    | +3    | +3|
|    **Q2**   |  :   |   :  |   :  | :    |  -2   |   -2  | -2|
| **Q3**   |  :  | :  | :  | +1 | +1   | +1 | +1 
| **Ans[]**   | 0   | 3  | 3  | 4  | 2  | 2   | 2 |


---
### Question
Return the final array after performing the queries

**Note:**
- **Query (i, x):** Add x to all the numbers from index i to N-1
- 0-based Indexing


```cpp
A = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Query(1, 3)
Query(0, 2)
Query(4, 1)
```

**Choices**
- [ ] [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
- [x] [2, 5, 5, 5, 6]
- [ ] [2, 3, 3, 3, 1]
- [ ] [2, 2, 5, 5, 6]

#### Explanation
|       Index |  0  | 1   | 2   | 3   |  4  |
|       ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Array**   |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|     **Q1**  |  :  | +3  | +3  | +3  | +3  |
|    **Q2**   |  +2 | +2  | +2  | +2  | +2  |
| **Q3**      |  :  |  :  |  :  |  :  | +1  |

### Perform multiple Queries from i to last index Solution Approaches

#### Brute force Approach
One way to approach this question is for a given number of Q queries, we can traverse the entire array each time. 


#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(Q * N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)


#### Optimized Solution

#### Hint:
* Wherever we're adding the value initially, the value is to be carried forward to the very last of the array isn't it?
* Which is the concept that helps us carry forward the sum to indices on right hand side ?

Expected: **Prefix Sum!**
 
* Idea is that first we add the values at the ith indices as per given queries. 
* Then, at the end, we can propagate those sum to indices on right.
* This way, we're only iterating over the array once unlike before.

#### Dry Run
| Index     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Array** | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| **Q1**    | :   | +3  | :   | :   | :   | :   | :   |
| **Q2**    | :   | :   | :   | :   | +2  | :   |     |
| **Q3**    | :   | :   | :   | +1  | :   | :   | :   |
| **Ans[]** | 0   | 3   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 0   |
| **psum[]** |  0   |  3   |  3   |  4   |  6   |  6   |  6   |

#### Pseudocode
```cpp
for (i = 0; i < Q.length; i++) {
    index = B[i][0];
    val = B[i][1];
    A[index] += val;
}
for (i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    A[i] += A[i - 1];
}
return A;
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(Q + N) 
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are only making changes to the answer array that needs to be returned.

### Problem 3 Perform multiple Queries from index i to j

#### Problem Statement

Given an integer array A such that all the elements in the array are 0. Return the final array after performing multiple queries

`Query: (i, j, x)`: Add x to all the elements from index i to j 

Given that `i <= j`

**Examples**
Let's take an example, say we have the zero-filled array of size 7 and the queries are given as 
q1 = (1, 3, 2)
q2 = (2, 5, 3)
q3 = (5, 6, -1)

---
### Question
Find the final array after performing the given queries on array of size **8**.
 |i  | j | x |
 |-  | - | - |
 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
 | 0 | 5 |-1 |
 | 2 | 2 | 4 |
 | 4 | 6 | 3 |
 

**Choices**
- [ ] 1 2 6 3 5 2 3 0
- [ ] -1 2 6 2 5 2 3 3
- [x] -1 2 6 2 5 2 3 0
- [ ] 1 2 6 3 5 2 0 3

---

#### Observations 
In the provided query format `Query: (i, j, x)`
here, start (i) and end (j) are specifiying a range wherein the values (x) needs to be added to the elements of the given array

#### Brute force Solution Approach
In this solution we can iterate through the array for every query provided to us and perform the necessary operation over it. 

#### Dry Run
The provided queries we have are
q1 = (1, 3, 2)
q2 = (2, 5, 3)
q3 = (5, 6, -1)

| Index  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arr[7] |  0  |  0  | 0   |  0  | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| V1     |     |   2 | 2   | 2   |     |     |     |
| V2     |     |     |  3  | 3   | 3   | 3   |     |
| V3     |     |     |     |     |     |  -1 |  -1 |
| Ans    |  0  |   2 |  5  |  5  |  3  |  2  | -1  |


#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(Q * N) 
**Space Complexity:** O(1) 

#### Optimized Solution

* This time, wherever we're adding the value initially, the value is to be carried forward only till a particular index, right?
* Can we use the Prefix Sum concept here are well ?
* How can we make sure that the value only gets added up till index j ?
* What can help us negate the effect of **+val** ?

#### Idea
* We can add the value at the starting index and subtract the same value just after the ending index which will help us to only carry the effect of **+val** till a specific index.
* From the index(k) where we have done **-val**, the effect will neutralise i.e,  from (k to N-1)


#### Pseudocode: 
```cpp
zeroQ(int N, int start[], int end[], int val[]) {
    long arr[N] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < Q; i++) {

        //ith query information: start[i], end[i], val[i]
        int s = start[i], e = end[i], v = val[i];

        arr[s] = arr[s] + v;

        if (e < n - 1) {
            arr[e + 1] = arr[e + 1] - v;
        }
    }

    //Apply cumm sum a psum[] on arr
    for (i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        arr[i] += arr[i - 1];
    }

    return arr;
}
    
```


#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(Q + N) 
**Space Complexity:** O(1) 


**Problem Statement**
Given N buildings with height of each building, find the rain water trapped between the buildings.

#### Example Explanation
Example: 
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1}

We now need to find the rainwater trapped between the buildings

**Ans: 8**

#### Hint:
If we get units of water stored over every building, then we can get the overall water by summing individual answers.

#### Observations
1. How much water is stored over **building 2** ? **-> 4 units**


<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/138/original/upload_1e8c00eedae54cb6b93c3d87945d152a.png?1695374556" width=300 />

2. Now, how much water is stored over **building 2** ? **still -> 4 units**

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/139/original/upload_48646dcd1fd44599afb23abe521026c8.png?1695374587" width=300 />

3. Now, how much water is stored over **building 2** ? **still -> 4 units**

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/140/original/upload_b6c255326a25dc18d22e80c225b962ab.png?1695374617" width=300 />

4. Now, how much water is stored over **building 2** ? **Now it is 6**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/141/original/upload_3faddfa43fec2bdff4817ab567b236c3.png?1695374641" width=300 />

5. Now, how much water is stored over **building 2** ? **Now it is 8**
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/142/original/upload_78cd8d3521ef7b1141f700a6a4947945.png?1695374662" width=300 />

#### Conclusion:
It depends on the height of the minimum of the largest buildings on either sides.

**Example:**
Water stored over building 5 depends on minimum of the largest building on either sides.
**i.e, min(10, 12) = 10**
**Water stored over 5 is 10 - 5 = 5 units.**

:warning: Please take some time to think about the solution approach on your own before reading further.....

### Rain Water Trapping Brute Force Approach

For **ith** building, 
We need to find maximum heights on both the left and right sides of **ith** building.

NOTE: For **0th** and **(N-1)th** building, no water will be stored on top.

#### Pseudocode (Wrong)
```cpp
ans = 0

for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; i++) {
    maxL = max(0 to i - 1); //loop O(N)
    maxR = max(i + 1 to N - 1); //loop O(N)

    water = min(maxL, maxR) - A[i];
    ans += water;
}
```

#### Edge Case

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/050/144/original/upload_fed83d7b202f6c0959ad932d3d5234f2.png?1695374778)" width=500 />

For building with height 4, the Lmax = 3 and Rmax = 3
min(3, 3) = 3
water = **3 - 4 < 0**

So, for such case, we'll take water stored as 0.

#### Pseudocode (Correct)
```cpp
ans = 0

for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; i++) {
    maxL = max(0 to i - 1); //loop O(N)
    maxR = max(i + 1 to N - 1); //loop O(N)

    water = min(maxL, maxR) - A[i];

    if (water > 0) {
        ans += water;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N^2) {Since for every element, we'll loop to find max on left and right}
**Space Complexity:** O(N)

### Rain Water Trapping Optimised Approach

We can store the max on right & left using carry forward approach.

* We can take 2 arrays, lmax[] & rmax[].
* Below is the calculation for finding max on left & right using carry forward approach.
* This way, we don't have to find max for every element, as it has been pre-calculated.

#### Pseudocode

```cpp
ans = 0;

int lmax[N] = {
    0
};
for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    lmax[i] = max(lmax[i - 1], A[i - 1]);
}

int rmax[N] = {
    0
};
for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    rmax[i] = max(rmax[i + 1], A[i + 1]);
}

for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; i++) {
    water = min(lmax[i], rmax[i]) - A[i];

    if (water > 0) {
        ans += water;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  O(N) {Since we have precalculated lmax & rmax}
**Space Complexity:**  O(N)
